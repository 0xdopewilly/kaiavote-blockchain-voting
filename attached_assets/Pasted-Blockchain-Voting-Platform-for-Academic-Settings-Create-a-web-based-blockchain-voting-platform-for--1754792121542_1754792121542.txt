Blockchain Voting Platform for Academic Settings
Create a web-based blockchain voting platform for students to vote for positions like Class Presidents, Departmental Presidents, Faculty Presidents, and Financial Secretaries.

Features
Voter Registration

Users register by providing their name, matric number, and wallet address.

Store all registration data (except wallet address) securely, with the option to update details.

Wallet Connection

Users must connect their wallet (e.g., MetaMask or another Web3 wallet) before voting.

Upon connection, authorize the user and confirm their eligibility to vote.

New Feature: After wallet connection, include a "Disconnect Wallet" button to allow the user to correct any connection errors, e.g., if the wrong wallet was connected.

Voting Process

Once authorized, users can select candidates from a list for each position (e.g., President, Financial Secretary).

Votes are securely recorded on the blockchain.

New Feature: Add a live metric/graphic on the right-hand side of the voting page to display the total votes for each candidate in real time, updating as votes are cast.

User Interface

Clean, user-friendly design for seamless registration, wallet connection, and voting.

Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

Security

Leverage blockchain for immutability and vote security.

Implement wallet authentication to ensure that only registered users can vote.

Platform Requirements
Blockchain: Ethereum or Base Sepolia Network (EVM compatible).

Web3 Integration: Integrate MetaMask or another Web3 wallet for wallet connection.

Voting Transparency: Ensure transparency in voting while securing the data on the blockchain.

GDPR Compliance: Ensure privacy and data security for personal details (name, matric number, etc.).

User Flow
Registration:

Users provide their name, matric number, and wallet address.

Wallet Connection:

Users connect their Web3 wallet (MetaMask or similar) for authentication.

New Feature: If the user has already registered, they should be automatically logged in after connecting their wallet, without needing to input matric number and name again.

Voting:

After wallet connection, users select a candidate and vote.

New Feature: A live metric/graphic on the voting page should show real-time vote updates.

Vote Recording:

Votes are securely recorded on the blockchain once cast.

Next Steps
Smart Contract Development:

Develop a smart contract to manage voter registration, wallet connection, and vote recording.

Ensure each user can only vote once by recording their wallet address in the hasVoted mapping.

Frontend Development:

Build a web interface to guide users through registration, wallet connection, and voting.

Integrate MetaMask (or another Web3 wallet) for seamless wallet connection.

Testing:

Deploy the contract on Base Sepolia Network for testing.

Test the full user flow from registration to vote recording, ensuring all features work smoothly, including live metrics and automatic login for registered users.

Additional Features/Considerations:
Page Navigation Flow:

Split the process into separate pages:

Page 1: Registration â†’ Wallet Connection.

Page 2: Voting (with live metrics/graphic).

Page 3: Thank You (Confirmation of vote submission).

Issues:

After registering, if the user connects their wallet, they should not need to input their matric number and name again. The system should automatically log them in.

ZKP Consideration:
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) could be integrated to enhance privacy. With ZKPs, you could prove that a user has registered and is eligible to vote without revealing their identity or other personal information, which would be a significant privacy enhancement. This could be especially valuable in an academic setting to ensure voter anonymity while confirming eligibility.

Would you like further exploration into integrating ZKPs, or do you want to leave it for a later stage?
